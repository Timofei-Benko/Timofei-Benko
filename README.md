### Hello there! 👋

<!--
**Timofei-Benko/Timofei-Benko** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

My name is Timofei and I'm currently studying Front-End Development, namely such technologies as HTML5, CSS3(+SCSS), JS(vanilla + React). Even though I'm relatively new to programming, I have quite a background in IT-industry as was working as a QA-engineer for some time. But now I decided to start doing something that I'm pasionate about. 

Feel free to look through my repositories to observe my progress. If you are willing to contact me, you can do it easily via my 💬 Telegram (@timofei_benko) or my email ✉️ timofeibenko@gmail.com)
